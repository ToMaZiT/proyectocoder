            <p class="story-text">The story and plot of OMORI revolves around a boy named SUNNY and his "alter-ego" OMORI. The game has two primary locations the story takes place in. The imaginary world of HEADSPACE is explored through OMORI and his friends at night, whereas SUNNY explores the real world via FARAWAY TOWN at daytime. There are also two routes that will ultimately determine the outcome of how the story will end.</p>

            <p class="story-data">The game begins with the main character, Omori, waking up in WHITE SPACE, a small room where he has lived "for as long as he can remember." Crossing the only door there, he enters the world of HEADSPACE, where his friends Aubrey, Kel, Hero, Basil and his older sister, Mari, are. At a picnic they begin to relive various memories together through Basil's photo album, who ends up inviting them to visit his house. Once there, Basil discovers a strange photo that makes him panic. Immediately, Omori is teleported to WHITE SPACE alone, this time without the door to exit, so his only option is to use a knife to stab himself, revealing that the previous events were part of a dream of a teenage boy named Sunny.</p>

Sunny, hungry, decides to go down to the kitchen, but halfway there he suffers a hallucination - which represents one of his fears - which he must face. Later, he goes back to bed and wakes up as Omori in WHITE SPACE, where he reunites with his friends, who discover that Basil has disappeared and set out to rescue him. The four explore the different regions of HEADSPACE in search of Basil, with the help of Mari. The group encounters many distractions during their search, and the characters gradually forget about Basil.</p>

            <p class="story-data">Meanwhile, in the real world, it is discovered that Mari committed suicide four years ago, which precipitated the separation of the group of friends. After the event, Kel and Hero managed, to a certain extent, to recover emotionally; Sunny, however, decided to isolate herself at home; Aubrey, on the other hand, felt betrayed when she perceived that others were indifferent to what had happened; and Basil developed anxiety and paranoia. Kel wants to reconnect with Sunny, so he knocks on her door. The player can decide whether he wants to open it or not: if he chooses not to, he will stay at home for the rest of the days until the move, confining himself to his tasks and his dreams.</p>
